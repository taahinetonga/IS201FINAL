                        <p>The most uncomfortable things I have done in life is what helped me grow the most. In middle school I joined the gymnastics team and learned of my flexability. I went on to play basketball and realized how little confidence I had in myself. When I was cut from the basketball team, I turned to wrestling. Although I may have had a negative opinion about wrestlers I was able to grow and drop +25lbs from the sport. I learned of hard work, grit, and what showing up for not only yourself but also your team.</p>
                        <p>After my highschool years, I went on to serve an 18 month mission. While the mission was hard, it was harder to come home and realize that I had to keep myself accountable to stay spiritual. When covid hit my mental health took an all time hit. I was going to school in Prove, Utah and struggling to make friends. How could I? We were stuck inside of our homes. I decided to work full-time while persuing my online education. I was able to make friends and learned that you can always turn a bad situation into a better one. It's all about perspective.</p>
                        <p>When classes finally opened up, I was still struggling to make friends. I almost decided to leave Utah and just go back home. I found a flier for the Women's Rugby Team and decided to tryout. From that short experience, I had found my lifetime friends. We are all at different stages in life, yet we all walk the same path of trials.</p>
                        <p>I took a break from Rugby in hopes of focusing on school. I have one more class to take before I could apply to the accounting program. I worked in the summer in construction in order to save money for this semester so that I didn't have to work. I truly enjoyed IS201 and would encourage everyone to take it. While it may not apply to all majors, it's a good class to learn computer skills.</p>
